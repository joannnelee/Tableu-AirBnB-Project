# Tableu AirBnB Project

### Project Overview 

In this project, a dashboard will be created showing visualizations for a client interested in listing a property in Seattle who wants further information on current listings. 

### Data Sources 

The data has been extracted from an Excel Spreadsheet containing 3 datasets: Listings, Calendar, and Reviews. 

### Tools

Tableu - To join the tables and create visualizations.

### Dashboard

The completed dashboard is shown below.

#### Average price per number of bedrooms
This visualization gives information on the average price of a listing based on the number of bedrooms. This is useful to the client to give them an idea of how much they can list their property for based on the number of bedrooms which could be used to estimate the profits they can earn on their listing. 

#### Number of listings by bedroom number 
This visualization shows the number of listings based on the number of bedrooms. This indicates the most popular number of bedrooms in AirBnB listings. This may be useful for the client when considering the demand for a specific number of bedrooms in an AirBnB property. 

#### Revenue for the Year 
This visualization gives insights into the revenue generated each week in 2016. This is useful for the client when deciding which periods are the most popular for listing properties, and therefore the best times they should list to generate the most income. 

#### Price per zip code 
Two visualizations are shown in the dashboard, a bar chart and a map. These show the average price of a listing based on their zip code. This is useful to the client who may be interested in seeing which locations will sell for the highest price. The bar chart is used to make it easy to see which zip codes sell for the highest prices and the map indicates the geographical location of the listings without needing to look up the zip code

### Results/Findings
1. As bedroom number increases, price increases and number of listings decreases - more bedrooms means you can sell for a higher price but there is less demand for more bedrooms.
2. The most revenue is generates in May/June and December - this is likely due to summer and Christmas holidays where more people are likely to go on holidays and rent accomodation.
3. 98119 is where the most listings are, this is likely since this area is close to the city centre where most people are likely to visit.

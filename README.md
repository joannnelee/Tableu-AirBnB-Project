# Tableau AirBnB Project

### Project Overview 

In this project, a dashboard will be created showing visualizations for a client interested in listing an AirBnB property in Seattle who wants further information on the current listings in the area. 

### Data Sources 

The data has been extracted from an Excel Spreadsheet containing 3 datasets: Listings, Calendar, and Reviews. 

### Tools

Tableau - To join the tables and create visualizations.

### Dashboard

The completed dashboard is shown below and can also be accessed [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joanne.lee6979/viz/AirBnBFullProject_17253550455810/Dashboard1?publish=yes)

#### Average price per number of bedrooms
This visualization gives information on the average price of a listing based on the number of bedrooms. This is useful to the client to give them an idea of how much they can list their property for based on the number of bedrooms which could be used to estimate the profits they can earn on their listing. 

#### Number of listings by bedroom number 
This visualization shows the number of listings based on the number of bedrooms. This indicates the most popular number of bedrooms in AirBnB listings. This may be useful for the client when considering the demand for a specific number of bedrooms in an AirBnB property. 

#### Revenue for the Year 
This visualization gives insights into the revenue generated each week in 2016. This is useful for the client when deciding which periods are the most popular for listing properties, and therefore the best times they should list to generate the most income. 

#### Price per zip code 
Two visualizations are shown in the dashboard, a bar chart and a map. These show the average price of a listing based on their zip code. This is useful to the client who may be interested in seeing which locations will sell for the highest price. The bar chart is used to make it easy to see which zip codes sell for the highest prices and the map indicates the geographical location of the listings without needing to look up the zip code

### Results/Findings
1. As bedroom number increases, price increases and the number of listings decreases - more bedrooms mean you can sell for a higher price but there is less demand for more bedrooms.
2. The most revenue is generated in May/June and December - this is likely due to the summer and Christmas holidays when more people are likely to go on holidays and rent accommodation.
3. When looking at the zip codes with the highest prices, urban, and city areas have the highest prices for listings. These areas tend to be more popular for people to visit as there is lots to do for visitors, therefore as there is more demand, listers can list their properties for higher prices.

### Limitations
1. Null values were excluded from the visualizations which could impact the accuracy of results.
2. The visualizations are based on 2016 data which may be outdated and therefore less accurate.

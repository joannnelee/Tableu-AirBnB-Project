#### Average price per number of bedrooms
This visualization gives information on the average price of a listing based on the number of bedrooms. This is useful to the client to give them an idea of how much they can list their property for based on the number of bedrooms which could be used to estimate the profits they can earn on their listing. 

#### Number of listings by bedroom number 
This visualization shows the number of listings based on the number of bedrooms. This indicates the most popular number of bedrooms in AirBnB listings. This may be useful for the client when considering the demand for a specific number of bedrooms in an AirBnB property. 

#### Revenue for the Year 
This visualization gives insights into the revenue generated each week in 2016. This is useful for the client when deciding which periods are the most popular for listing properties, and therefore the best times they should list to generate the most income. 

#### Price per zipcode
